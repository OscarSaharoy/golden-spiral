# golden-spiral

Tool to make animations of dot spirals.

## [CodePen Link](https://codepen.io/oscarsaharoy/pen/NWdqxqW)

When the angle between the direction each dot is placed at is the golden angle, the spiral spaces the dots as far apart as possible. This is why the spiral appears in nature often, where evolution has optimised to the most space-efficient angle.
